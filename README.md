# Algebraic Data Types, Compilers and Swift

http://www.meetup.com/Pittsburgh-Functional-Programming-Meetup/events/227960185/

Algebraic Data Types is a data construct that is slowly making its way to newer multi-paradigm programming languages: Swift, Nim, Rust, etc.

In order to learn and showcase the power of Algebraic Data Types we will be using them to build a part of a compiler in Swift. Never wrote a compiler before? No worries, you'll be surprised at how easy it is with the right tools.

Bring a computer; this is a hands on talk with programming exercises.
